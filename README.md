# API Project: File Metadata Microservice

### Demo:
- https://k0o97-file-metadata-fcc.glitch.me
### User stories:
1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response.
